Java interviews often focus on memory management, the JVM, and robust Object-Oriented principles.

How does the HashMap work internally in Java?

Focus: Understanding buckets, hashing, and how Java 8+ handles collisions using balanced trees instead of linked lists when a threshold is met.

What is the difference between fail-fast and fail-safe iterators?

Focus: Concurrent modification exceptions. ArrayList is fail-fast, while CopyOnWriteArrayList is fail-safe.

Explain the Java Memory Model (Stack vs. Heap).

Focus: Where objects live (Heap) versus where method executions and local variables live (Stack), and how Garbage Collection fits in.

What are "Functional Interfaces" and why were they introduced in Java 8?

Focus: Interfaces with exactly one abstract method (like Runnable or Callable) that enable Lambda expressions.

What is the difference between checked and unchecked exceptions?

Focus: Compile-time enforcement (IOException) versus runtime errors (NullPointerException).
