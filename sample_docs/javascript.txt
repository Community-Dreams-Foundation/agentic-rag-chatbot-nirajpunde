JavaScript interviews almost always test your understanding of the Event Loop and asynchronous execution.

Explain the Event Loop and Task Queue.

Focus: How JS handles non-blocking I/O despite being single-threaded. Understanding the priority of Microtasks (Promises) vs. Macrotasks (setTimeout).

What is "Hoisting" in JavaScript?

Focus: How variable and function declarations are moved to the top of their scope, and the difference between var, let, and const in this context.

What are Closures and give a practical use case.

Focus: A function's ability to "remember" its lexical scope even when executed outside that scope (often used for data privacy).

Difference between == and ===.

Focus: Type coercion. == checks value, while === checks both value and type.

Explain Prototypal Inheritance.

Focus: How objects inherit properties from other objects, unlike the class-based inheritance found in Java.
